# AeroGameFramework Change Log

The following are updates that have been implemented into the framework, so you can understand the impact of upgrading the plugin or framework as changes are made.

Understand that the framework may change frequently, so upcoming changes may break compatiblility with previous versions. Before upgrading, it is recommended that you read this `CHANGELOG.md` to see if there are BC Breaks, otherwise known as backwards-compatibility breaks, which may have an impact on your implementation against the framework working.

Anything noted with a ==[BC Break]== you should be cautious about upgrading until you understand what refactoring you may have to do in order to support the framework version.

If a version has a backwards-compatibility break, and you are not ready to upgrade to that version, you can always look at our version tags in Github and checkout to use a previous version. Although, this would be a manual process for you to copy the scripts for the particular version and should not upgrade using the auto updater, since that will always provide the latest version.

As always, you can also check the commit history for a given version as well, and examine the specific lines of code changed to understand how this may impact your project.

### Version History Notes

#### <a name="1.2.3"></a> Version 1.2.3
Added the `WrapModule` method to both the AeroServer and AeroClient scripts. This method takes a `table` and will set its metatable to the same metatable used by other Aero-based modules/controllers/services. This allows you to easily integrate custom modules into the framework if needed.

Internally, this sets the metatable of the given table, and also calls the associated `Start` and `Init` methods if available.

Client example:
```lua
while (not _G.Aero) do wait() end

local Test = {}
local fade

function Test:Start()
  fade:SetText("Hello world")
  fade:Out()
  fade:In()
end

function Test:Init()
  local fade = self.Controllers.Fade
end

-- Set up the table to integrate with the framework:
_G.Aero:WrapModule(Test)
```

#### <a name="1.2.2"></a> Version 1.2.2
Added Failed events for DataService. The DataService has always retried requests if DataStore calls have failed; however, it used to silently fail with a simple `warn()` if the maximum retry limit was reached. In this update, the service will now call an appropriated Failed event corresponding to the type of data call.

In order to make this function, there are also Failed events added to the internal modules used by the DataService module. This includes the DataStoreCache and SafeDataStore.

- If setting player data, then the `PlayerFailed(player, method, key, errMsg)` event will be fired, as well as the client `Failed(method, key, errMsg)` event.
- If setting global data, then the `GlobalFailed(method, key, errMsg)` event will be fired.
- If setting custom data, then the `CustomFailed(name, scope, method, key, errMsg)` event will be fired.
